I have used Public MQTT Broker to communicate to nodemcu (Esp8266) from android application. so I can control relay switch using nodemcu from anywhere.




android studio apk project files and code of nodemcu are available, 
Replace "Serialtopic" by your topic in apk project files,
Serialtopic should be same as nodemcu topic inside the code of nodemcu.
android application can communicate with nodemcu from anywhere as long as both are comnnected to internet.
